# Lizard Up

It's a game I made in high school in like 2014 or 2015. Originally released
as an iOS app, this is the original source code. The iOS app was
just a wrapped HTML app because iOS was not fond of web apps
at the time. Now it's a HTML5 app for everyone. Download
The zip, play it online, or download the experimental 
Web Bundle version.

It was originally a fully copyrighted work, but is now available
under GPL-3.0 so you can share or modify it for free.
